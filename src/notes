diff between a and link
 similar but when u use a the page will reload but in react u cant do that so link

 u write href in a but in link we write "to"

 1:navlink will give u more additional things then link

 we write a callback in it and u will have a direct access of one variable called isActive
  and in back ticks u will write it and by using ternary operator



  //Routerprovider component will take one prop that is router,,and u have to make one router now
  createbrowserrouter is amethod u have to craeter a router using that

  outlet a power thing which react dom gives so that where u give u can change the things dynamicallyy
  between header and footer i give means header footer is constant and u can change in between

  and if u want to use the layout component u yhave to tell in index so that i am giving everything indside of it


  u can create router like this also
  const router=createBrowserRouter(
    createRoutesFromElements(
        <Route path='/' element={<Layout/>}>
        <Route path='' element={<Home/>}/>
        </Route>
    )
  )


  u als0 can do using loader if u want to get data from apis
